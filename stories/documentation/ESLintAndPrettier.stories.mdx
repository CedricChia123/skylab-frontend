# ESLint and Prettier

According to the CS2103T textbook:

> The aim of a coding standard is to make the entire code base look like it was written by one person.

ESLint and Prettier help to enforce a coding standard with a set of rules to adhere to the laid out principle.

## ESLint

ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript and TypeScriptcode. ESLint is configurable with configs, plugins, and individual rules can be customized.

Currently, an automated check is run with `husky` during commits and a GitHub action is run when pushing code to ensure that the code adheres to the outlined standard.

To modify the ESLint configuration (**only do this if you have a good reason**), you can view the `.eslintrc.json` config file in the root of the project folder. Here, you can see all the configs, plugins, and rules.

The following are the list of plugins and configs utilized in the project:

- `eslint-config-next` - Recommended by [Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint) to integrate ESLint with Next.js
- `eslint-config-prettier` - Turns off rules that might conflict with prettier
- `eslint-plugin-import` - Supports linting of ES6+ import/export syntax
- `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` - Static AST checker to ensure accessibility rules are being adhered to
- `eslint-plugin-react` - React specific linting rules
- `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` - Enforces the [Rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html)
- `eslint-plugin-storybook` - Best practice rules for Storybook

## Prettier

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that helps to enforce consistent coding style in your codebase.

Such coding styles include:

- The width of tabs
- Whether code should end with a semicolon
- Whether strings should use single or double quotes
- Whether trailing commas should be used
- etc.

To modify the Prettier configuration (**only do this if you have a good reason**), you can view the `.prettierrc.json` config file in the root of the project folder.
