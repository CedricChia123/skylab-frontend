# Git Workflow

### Protected Branches

The industry standard is to always keep the `main` branch ready and to never push un-tested code directly to the `main` branch. As such, we have adopted a similar system.

We will have two protected branches:

1. `production`

- The `production` branch will be the branch that deploys directly to the NUS SoC VM to be hosted on the official Skylab URL
- The website will also be pointing to the production database where all the data of the Orbital programme are stored.
- The `production` branch will only receive pull requests from the `staging` branch

2. `staging`

- The `staging` branch deploys directly to a staging site
- The website will be pointing to a staging database where the data can be freely manipulated for testing
- The `staging` branch is meant for developer and user testing before a new feature goes live on the `production` branch
- The `staging` branch will receive pull requests from feature branches worked on by developers

### Feature Branching

Feature branch workflow is a workflow where all developers pull and push from the same remote repository.

To develop a new feature/fix, developers will:

1. Create a new branch from `staging` and develop within that branch, regularly merging/rebasing any new commits in staging back into the feature branch.
2. Once the feature is complete, the developer should push their code and make a pull request to the `staging` branch.
3. The pull request should be reviewed by at least one other developer and only be merged to `staging` once approved.

This workflow allows developers to develop independently, ensure code quality, and minimize merge conflicts while simultaneously ensuring that the overhead is not as high as compared to a forking workflow.
