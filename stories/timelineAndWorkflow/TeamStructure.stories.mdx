# Team Structure

## Team

Our team is comprised of the following software engineers:

| Name                 | Email                       | Telegram |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | -------- |
| Loh Jia Ming, Rayner | raynerljm@u.nus.edu         | @raypuff |
| N Vijay Narayanan    | n.vijay.narayanan@u.nus.edu | @myc37   |
| Zechary Au Jun Wen   | zecharyajw@u.nus.edu        | @zechajw |

## Structure

We will be following an egoless or democratic team structure. This means that every team member is equal in terms of responsibility and accountability and when any decision is required, a consensus must be reached. We decided upon this as the team is small and thus there is little communication overhead. Furthermore, all of us are similar in experience level and thus are able to contribute equally.
