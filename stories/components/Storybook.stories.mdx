# Welcome to Skylab v2 UI Library

The UI for Skylab v2 is mostly built on top of [Material UI v5](https://mui.com/). However, we still have to build new components or custom wrappers for these components. As such, Storybook serves as an interactive way to design, develop and test these new components.

## How do I use Storybook?

If you are a developer working on Skylab v2's front end, documenting any new pages/components you create and any modifications made to pre-existing components/pages is a **part of your responsibility**. As such, please do read up on Storybook's [tutorials](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/) and [docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction) in order to familiarize yourself on how to document these.

## How is it currently configured?
