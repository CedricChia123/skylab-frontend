# NUS Skylab v2

Skylab v2 is a student-developed project to support [NUS Orbital (CP2106)](https://orbital.comp.nus.edu.sg/) by allowing students, advisers, mentors, and administrators to use the platform to run the program.

> **Orbital** (a.k.a., CP2106: Independent Software Development Project) is the School of Computingâ€™s 1st year summer self-directed, independent work course. This programme gives students the opportunity to pick up software development skills on their own, using sources on the web. All while receiving course credit in the form of 4 modular credits of Unrestricted Electives (UE). SoC provides the Orbital framework for helping students stay motivated and driven to complete a project of their own design, by structuring peer evaluation, critique and presentation milestones over the summer period.

Skylab v2 has the intention of replacing the pre-existing [Skylab](https://nusskylab-dev.comp.nus.edu.sg/) for the following reasons:

1. To use a modern tech stack to that it is easier for more students to be enrolled to maintain the platform
   - Skylab v1 uses Ruby on Rails
   - Skylab v2 uses PERN
2. To improve pre-existing features to support the UX of administrators
3. To revamp the existing UI to provide a more intuitive workflow for all users of the platform.

## Project Setup

If you have not already setup the project on your system, please proceed to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/orbital-skylab/skylab-frontend) and view the README's installation and startup guide on how to setup the project.

## Storybook documentation structure

From the sidebar on the left side of the screen, there should be **3** main categories:

### 1. Documentation

> This category is for all documentation related to requirements and design choices of the application.

This includes design choices such as:

- Folder structure
- Tech stack chosen
- Abstractions utilized
- Dependencies installed

This includes requirements such as:

- Non functional requirements
- Features of the application

### 2. Components

> This category is for all documentation related to the UI of the application.

Before you create a new component, ask yourself whether you can either:

- Reuse a component that has already been created and documented before hand; or
- Use a component from [Material UI v5](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-button/)

By doing so, this leads to the following benefits:

1. Less design/development work for you
2. More visual cohesiveness across the platform
3. Less opportunities for bugs as the component should have been used and tested before

### 3. Timeline and Workflow

> This category is _specifically_ for the initial development of Skylab v2 (May 2022 - July 2022)

Here, we document the following:

- Our team and team structure
- Our issue tracking system
- Our Git workflow and conventions (eg. branch and commit naming)
- Our work breakdown structure

## Storybook Publishing

Storybook is automatically published upon every push. The CI is configured via `.github/workflows/chromatic.yml`. Chromatic a project meant for deployment, reviewing and testing of Storybook.

After pushing to a branch with `branch_name`, the published Storybook should be visible from:
https://<branch_name>--62937ed0318229004a51a095.chromatic.com/?path=/story/introduction--page).

Additionally, the project page can be viewed [here](https://www.chromatic.com/builds?appId=62937ed0318229004a51a095) where you can see the build history.
