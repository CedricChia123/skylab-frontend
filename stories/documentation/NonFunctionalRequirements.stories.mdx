# Non Functional Requirements (NFRs)

According to the CS2103T textbook:

> Non-functional requirements specify the constraints under which the system is developed and operated.

The following are NFRs that we have outlined for Skylab v2:

| Category        | Description                                                                                                  | Priority |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Security        | Non-admin users should not be able to perform tasks which require admin privileges                           | 1        |
| Security        | Users should not be able to modify the submissions of other teams                                            | 1        |
| Security        | The system should have basic protection against cyber attacks (Conduct a fortify scan)                       | 1        |
| Performance     | The project gallery should not take longer than 2 seconds to load per cohort per LoA                         | 2        |
| Performance     | The project gallery should not take longer than 0.5 seconds to load per cohort per LoA                       | 4        |
| Scalability     | The system should be able to handle at least 500 active teams and their submissions                          | 1        |
| Scalability     | The system should be able to handle at least 800 active teams and their submissions                          | 1        |
| Maintainability | There should be sufficient documentation for new developers to quickly understand the system and maintain it | 1        |
| Maintainability | The system should only rely on well-maintained, well-documented, and necessary dependencies                  | 1        |
| Usability       | The system should be usable by a first-time Orbital student and a first-time Orbital mentor                  | 2        |
| Devices         | The system should be accessible from both mobile devices and computer systems                                | 1        |
