# Dependencies

As per the non functional requirements, we should only depend on libraries/dependencies that fulfil some conditions:

- They are well-maintained
- They are well-documented
- They are necessary

By only depending on such libraries, we stand to gain the following benefits:

- We do not have to worry about updating libraries that cause breaking changes
- We do not unnecessarily increase the bundle size and slow down our application
- We have a deeper understanding of how the code works instead of relying on (possibly overly complex) libraries

## Dependencies and Justifications

As such, this section is to document and justify the libraries that we are using

### Dependencies

| Dependency  | Version | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Material UI | 5.7.0   | A UI library helps us develop faster while maintaing a cohesive visual design. Additionally, MUI is very widely used and well documented so many React developers should already be familiar with its usage.                                                               |
| Formik      | 2.2.9   | Formik is a form management library. Skylab requires many forms, from pre-defined ones to dynamically generated ones, and having a form management library would provide many complex abstractions for such use cases that we would otherwise have to implement ourselves. |
| Yup         | 0.32.11 | Yup is an object schema library that integrates extremely well with Formik for inline form validation. It is an extremely lightweight library that is very stable and widely used.                                                                                         |

### Developer Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Reason                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ESLint     | 8.15.0  | ESLint is a (very) widely used industry standard for analyzing code. ESLint is explored further under the `ESLint and Prettier` section.                |
| Prettier   | 2.6.2   | Prettier is another widely used industry standard for enforcing coding standards. Prettier is explored further under the `ESLint and Prettier` section. |
| Storybook  | 6.5.5   | Storybook is a documentation library with many weekly users on npm. It provides a great UX for readers and developers alike.                            |
