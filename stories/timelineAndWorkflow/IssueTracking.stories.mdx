# Issue Tracking

According to the CS2103T textbook:

> Issue trackers (sometimes called bug trackers) are commonly used to track task assignment and progress.

For this project, we have decided to use Jira to document all our issues. This is because Jira comes with a built in epic/task system with workflow stages that are automatically set up for users. This reduces the overhead in setting up a system manually and allows us to develop efficiently.
